# Credit_Risk_Analysis
The Credit Risk Analysis System predicts the likelihood of loan defaults using historical loan data, financial details, credit history, and demographics to classify applicants as low, medium, or high risk. This aids financial institutions in making informed loan decisions, optimizing risk, and enhancing efficiency.

# Key Features:
1.	Loan Risk Classification: Classify applicants into risk categories based on credit scores and other features.
2.	Predictive Analytics: Forecast the probability of default using machine learning algorithms.
3.	Customer Insights: Analyze patterns and factors influencing creditworthiness.
4.	Interactive Dashboard: Provide a dynamic interface to visualize insights and predictions.
5.	Customizable Filters: Enable filtering by loan type, demographic attributes, or financial details.
6.	Exportable Reports: Generate detailed reports summarizing risk analysis for decision-making

# Technologies Used:
1.	Frontend/UI: [**Streamlit**] For interactive and easy-to-use dashboards.
2.	Backend: [**Python**] For data processing and machine learning model integration.
3.	Machine Learning: [**Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost**] For classification and risk prediction.
4.	Data Management: [**Pandas and NumPy**] For cleaning and analyzing data.
5.	Visualization: [**Plotly and Matplotlib**] For visualizing trends and distributions.
6.  Deployment: [**Render**] For deploying the predictions.

# Procedures:
